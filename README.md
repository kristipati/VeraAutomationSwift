VeraAutomation
==========

This is the Swift version of my Vera automation app at https://github.com/sgruby/VeraAutomation

--

This is a basic iOS app for controlling a Vera automation system. It was designed around my personal VeraLite setup and not all parts will work for everyone. The Audio control part only works with a custom Vera plugin that I wrote to talk to my Russound audio units over TCP/IP. You can also set which devices and scenes to exclude using the Settings tab.

This is a work in progress. The app works on the iPhone and iPad. I use the app everyday and it works pretty well in my setup.
